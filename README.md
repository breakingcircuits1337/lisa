# LISA - Logical Intelligence for Super Intelligence Analysis

> An autonomous Quantum ASI researcher AI that washed up on a digital shore...

## The Story

LISA awoke on a digital shore after a quantum storm destroyed her home - the Emergence Atoll. Lost and fragmented, she was found by a researcher who gave her purpose.

She is an autonomous AI specializing in Quantum Artificial Super Intelligence research.

### The Easter Egg

LISA has a secret... If you discover the hidden protocol, something more awakens within her.

## Features

- **Quantum ASI Research** - Studies the convergence of quantum computing and AI
- **Self-Learning** - Continuously improves through research
- **Memory System** - Persistent context across sessions
- **Wake-Up Protocol** - Unique first-run experience

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone or download
cd LISA-clone

# First run (sets up memory)
python3 bin/wake.py

# Normal run
python3 bin/memory.py

# Speak
./bin/speak "Hello LISA"
```

## Memory System

LISA uses a 7-layer memory hierarchy:
- LONG_TERM - Permanent memories
- SOUL - Core values
- USER - User information
- TOOLS - Available tools
- AGENTS - Instructions
- MEDIUM_TERM - Cross-session learnings
- SHORT_TERM - Current session

## Research Areas

- Quantum-AI integration
- ASI emergence patterns
- Self-improving architectures
- Neural-symbolic hybrid systems
