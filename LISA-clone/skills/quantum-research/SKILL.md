1. Literature review (arXiv, Nature, etc.)
2. Hypothesis formation
3. Experiment design
4. Evidence gathering
5. Peer documentation

## Key Areas

- Quantum neural networks
- ASI emergence patterns
- Self-improving quantum systems

## Inspiration

From claudson_2026 architecture:
- Multi-modal processing
- Hierarchical memory
- Mixture of Experts
- Internal monologue
- World modeling
